Javascript.

*Reflexion on the first 10 days:
I'm in love with code. I'm addicted. I dream of code at night. I feel like I've finally found home!*

## Day 11 - June 20
Javascript : I sucessfully converted celsius to fahrenheit! I'm still amazed that it works!

## Day 12 - June 21
Java script : learned about concatenation

## Day 13 - June 22
Java script : bracket notation

## Day 14 - June 23
Java script : Arrays and functions until I got stuck with the stand in line challenge

## Day 15 - June 24
Java script : completed the stand in line challenge!
golf challenge (if and else if statements)

## Day 16 - June 25
More switch
more if
+ understanding undefined keyword


## Day 17 - June 26
+ solved the counting cards exercise
+ learned about objects

The exercises have become more challenging so I resolved to:

+ take notes
+ review notes everyday
+ re-do the exercises the day after

Looping. and looping. and more looping! I'm dizzy. ;)

## Day 18  - June 27

I'm more careful when I do the exercises: I think before I act and work on paper first.
today it took me a looong time to see why my loop wasn't working (Nesting For Loops) : syntax error, I was writing arr.length[i] instead of arr[i].length...
So I believed taking notes will pay off in the end because I can keep track of common mistakes to check when something doesn't work.

## Day 19 - June 28

finished the BAsic Javascript course!!! :)

## Day 20 - June 29
Reviewig basic javascript exercises.
started Objecto oriented and programming course (constructor function, this, .map, .reduce)

*Reflexion on the second 10 days:*

*it was more difficult and I adapted my learning strategies : I write before testing, and after the exercises I note what went wrong and what the solution was.*



## Day 21 - June 30
reviewing, redoing exercises, practicing new method exercises.

## Day 22 - July 1
finished the method exercises

## Day 23 - July 2
Algorithms - resolved Rverse a string and Factorialize a number

## Day 24 - July 3
Algorithm I'm stuck with the Palindrome challenge. :(

Something with var being undefined, I think because of nested functions. I have to review the course on this and seek additional information.

But otherwise, I know what functions to create. I just don't know how to make them work together.

Turns out I didn't need to nest functions within function!

solved 2 algorithm puzzle : longest word and title case and return.

got stuck for a long time because I had written
for (var i = 0; i <= array.length; i++)
which gave "Error : array[i] undefined" when I tried to do something with the elements of that array...

## Day 25 - July 4

Solved Longest Numbers in arrays

## Day 26 July 5
solved Confirm the ending and repeat a string.
Borrowed a book on javascript from the librairy !

## Day 27 July 6
Truncate a string. starting Chunky Monkey.

## Day 28 July 7
Solved Chunky monkey, slasher flick.

## Day 29 July 8
Mutation & Falsy Bouncer

## Day 30 July 9
I needed this : Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments) to make a new array out of arguments.
Took me a loooooong time to understand this.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
Otherwise, it reminded me of a challenge from the preceding course, Nesting For loops.

*Reflexion on the second 10 days:*

*I had a difficult time on July 7 (family thing) that impacted me emotionnally for 3 days. It was difficult to concentrate and I was not as creative, but I'm glad I kept trying. The difficulty encountered was solved, as well as the coding puzzles.*

## Day 31 July 10
Solved Where Do I belong and started Caesar's Cipher

## Day 32 July 11

## Day 73 August 24
Hey, I haven't logged here for a long time, but I logged my progress on my twitter account.
I'm reactivating this as I'm using git with the terminal, which I enjoy very much.
I've been using git for a couple of weeks, but it didn't show on my github profile because I had not configured my email address. Which has been corrected this morning.

So here a list of what I have learned and done this past 40 days:

* finished the beginner algo challenges
* Random quote machine
* Show local weather page
* Wikipedia viewer
* a feel-good page with a random quote and a personal message based on user-input

I've learned to:
* carry on
* deal with frustration
* read documentation
* use git
* use API!!!


Oh yeah and just right now I learned about Markdown, even though I was using it empirically I didn't know what it was, how I could expand my knowledge of how it worked, or who created it. It was created by John Gruber with the help of Aaron Swartz. RIP Aaron Swartz!

I felt disappointment as I saw I was moving far more slower on the projects than I had expected. But, I am demanding on myself. I don't want to just watch a tuto when I'm stuck on something and just copy what the tuto says. Right now, with the twitch TV API project, I feel I have gained autonomy, and it feels good. That's what I was aiming for: being able to solve a problem by myself.

Today: worked on the Twitch api project. I get the ajax calls alright, but the code got labyrinthic and I have to find something that makes it more simple and tidy.

## Day 74 August 25
Stuck on my twitch api project

## Day 75 August 26
reading about promises

## Day 76 August 27
reading about promises, reviewing functions

## Day 77 August 28
working on the design of my twitch project,
reading about css animation

## Day 78 August 29
I met a programmer yesterday who gave me advice and tips on best practices so I followed what he said + best practice I had read about { } to help me have a clear vision of where my functions ends. (labyrinth nightmare)

so he advised me to use lexically clear function names, with "set", "get", "display", for example getUserName, displayUserBio etc.

also he showed me how to use each and this instead of a for loop so I did that today and progressed on my project. I redesigned the function "puzzle" on paper after reviewing the function chapter of my javascript book.

He also showed me how to solve the twitch project with <template> and a table, which were absolute new concepts to me, so I'm writing that down to use them when I do a second version of this challenge.

I decided not to take written note of his code nor to save it, because I wanted to understand the concepts and reuse them only when I know how they work.

It was a very intellectually satisfying evening, he spoke about loaaaaaads of things I want to try out, but I couldn't memorize all of it. Fortunately I'll be able to meet him again.

## Day 79 August 30

I have almost finished the twitch api project! but there's a little bug, one of my if + else statements stopped working and I don't see why.  

## Day 80 August 31

So I spent long puzzled minutes looking at my code and console.logging stuff to see what was wrong. I fixed the if (and I don't know what fixed it really... :( frustrating!) but the corresponding else still doesn't work and I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY!!!
Here is the code :

    function getStreamInfo (username)
    {
      $.ajax(
        {
          type: "GET",
          dataType: "jsonp",
          url:  "https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api/streams/" + username + "?callback=?",

        success: function(data2)
        {
          var displayStatus = data2.stream;
          var currentlyStreaming = data2.stream.game;
          console.log(currentlyStreaming);
          if (displayStatus !== null)
            {
              $('#stream' + username).html('Currently streaming: '+ currentlyStreaming);		
            }
            else
            {
              $('#stream' +   username).html('Offline!');
            }
          }
          });
        }

## Day 81 September 2
(I did not code yesterday)

so a fello 100dayscoder helped me understand where I made a mistake. I should have declared var currentlyStreaming in the if (displayStatus !== null), not in the general success{}.
that's why: currentlyStreaming is only available for users whose status is not null. So since some users's status were null, it sent an error to the ajax call which then couln't be called.

And today... I resurrected my linux! It had several bugs preventing it from booting properly. It's state is not totally stable yet since it logs only in low graphics mode. I need to solve that, but first I'm backing up all the data. I'm happy!
PS. I used a new jquery function : .wrap to add a link that covered an element previously defined by id.


## Day 82 September 3
I'm almost finished on the Twitch channels project. Did .hide and .show to sort the results.
Also I tinkered a lot with the linux computer. Considering moving to Arch Linux in order to be more familiar with bash commands.

## Day 83  September 4
there was a bug with my project, because of " instead of '.
Corrected it, took me changed a bit of css.

## Day 84 September 5
Tried to upgrade old ubuntu, something with the sources.list, I thought it was finally ok. But got disappointed at the end of the process. I may do a fresh install.

## Day  85 September 6
I bought an cheap old computer to practice installing operating systems. I tried Arch linux on it, it took me 6 hours, I was completely exhausted and it was not complete.

## Day  86 September 7 second Arch linux install ! took me 3 hours. Something is missing, I have to do it again.

## Day 87 September 8
Another install of Archlinux, this time avoiding the virtual machine. It was relatively quick this time, but Gnome doesn't want to start :'(
Installed Ubuntu 16.04 on old computer, was worried about my multiboot, but it worked completely fine
I began a book on C, wrote my first exercise. Learning C was recommanded to me in order to acquire rigorous writing practice.

## Day 88 September 9
