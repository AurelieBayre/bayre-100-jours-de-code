Ahem. Sorry (mostly to myself) for not logging in there more often! :(  I only log on twitter daily.
Updates, lots of good news:
* I was selected for a Google Developer Challenge Scholarship! This allows me to study mobile web dev on Udacity.
* I was accepted to a very cool school that's opening in my hometown in February: [Wild Code School Reims](https://wildcodeschool.fr/reims/) I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO START!!!
* I've been practicing pair-programming a lot with [@hanapotski](https://github.com/hanapotski) ([@homemadecoder](https://twitter.com/homemadecoder) on twitter) It's really good practice, I've learned a lot of theoretical stuff I had only empirically dabbled with previously. She knows a lot!
* Back in October, I completed HacktoberFest and I will receiving my goodies in a few weeks now.


## 26. Saturday, Oct. 19
When I click on the buttons, I want the digit to display on a certain div. I want them to appear side by side, I don't want them to replace each other on the div. So .innerHTML is not the thing to use. 
I found this, got to try it :
[.insertAdjacentHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)

## 25. Saturday, Oct. 18
basic layout for the calc + concluded that I have to find a way to prioritize multiply and devide operation over addition and substraction. 
I think I can do a switch statement over an array determined by user's starting to click and clicking Equal. Iterating every 2 elements (= every time a sign is clicked)
